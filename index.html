                Under The Sea Dance. Our first date. It was the night of that terrible thunderstorm, remember George?
                Your father kissed me for the very first time on that dance floor.

                Great good, good, Lorraine, I had a feeling about you two. Good, there's somebody I'd like you to meet.
                Lorraine. I, I don't know. Look, George, I'm telling you George, if you do not ask Lorraine to that
                dance, I'm gonna regret it for the rest of my life.

                That's good advice, Marty. Whoa, whoa, okay. I hope so. Who's are these? Wrecked?
                What's the meaning of this. She's just trying to keep you respectable. So tell me, Marty, how long have
                you been in port?

                out for the count, right? And you and Lorraine live happily ever after. Oh yes sir. I have a feeling
                too. Marty, such a nice name. Quiet down, I'm sure the car is fine.

                        Isn't
                        tonight the night of the big date? No, it was The Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. Our first
                        date.
                        It was the night of that terrible thunderstorm, remember George? Your father kissed me for the
                        very
                        first time on that dance floor. It was then I realized I was going to spend the rest of my life
                        with
                        him. Alright, McFly, you're asking for it, and now you're gonna get it.
                        Mom, Dad. Oh, what I meant to day was- Just say anything, George, say what ever's natural, the
                        first
                        thing that comes to your mind. Calvin, why do you keep calling me Calvin? Where were we.
                        Yeah, but I never picked a fight in my entire life. Bear with me, Marty, all of your questions
                        will
                        be answered. Roll tape, we'll proceed. That's for messing up my hair. Mr. McFly, Mr. McFly, this
                        just arrived, oh hi Marty. I think it's your new book. Whoa, they really cleaned this place up,
                        looks brand new.
