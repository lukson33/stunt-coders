        <p>Ah, where're my pants? Um, yeah well I might have sort of ran into my parents. Biff. Well, it will just

                Right, gimme a Pepsi free. Hey I'm talking to you, McFly, you Irish bug. No, it was The Enchantment
                Under The Sea Dance. Our first date. It was the night of that terrible thunderstorm, remember George?
                Your father kissed me for the very first time on that dance floor. It was then I realized I was going to
                spend the rest of my life with him. I don't know, I can't keep up with all of your boyfriends. Well,
                this is a radiation suit.
                Precisely. Okay Doc, this is it. Now Biff, don't con me. What, what is it hot? Huh?
                What were you doing in the middle of the street, a kid your age. My name's Lorraine, Lorraine Baines. I
                said the keys are in here. C'mon, Mom, make it fast, I'll miss my bus. Hey see you tonight, Pop. Woo,
                time to change that oil. Good. Have a good trip Einstein, watch your head.

            <h2>It will just happen</h2>
            <p>
                Great good, good, Lorraine, I had a feeling about you two. Good, there's somebody I'd like you to meet.
                Lorraine. I, I don't know. Look, George, I'm telling you George, if you do not ask Lorraine to that
                dance, I'm gonna regret it for the rest of my life. Yeah, well uh, lets keep this brain melting stuff to
                ourselves, okay?
                Now which one was it, Greg or Craig? Let's get you into a radiation suit, we must prepare to reload.
                Calm down, Marty, I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of Einstein and the car are
                completely intact. Hey I'm talking to you, McFly, you Irish bug. No no no no no, Marty, both you and
                Jennifer turn out fine. It's your kids, Marty, something has got to be done about your kids.
                You okay, is everything alright? Well, what if they didn't like them, what if they told me I was no
                good. I guess that would be pretty hard for somebody to understand. Doc. Hello. Holy shit.

            <h2>Calculations are correct</h2>
            <p>
                That's good advice, Marty. Whoa, whoa, okay. I hope so. Who's are these? Wrecked?
                What's the meaning of this. She's just trying to keep you respectable. So tell me, Marty, how long have
                you been in port? Yeah, well history is gonna change. Marty, such a nice name.
                Please, Marty, don't tell me, no man should know too much about their own destiny. You know Marty, I'm
                gonna be very sad to see you go. You've really mad a difference in my life, you've given me something to
                shoot for. Just knowing, that I'm gonna be around to se 1985, that I'm gonna succeed in this. That I'm
                gonna have a chance to travel through time. It's going to be really hard waiting 30 years before I could
                talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.
                Good, you could start by sweeping the floor. Right, gimme a Pepsi free. Where does he come from?

                Yes, definitely, god-dammit George, swear. Okay, so now, you come up, you punch me in the stomach, I'm
                out for the count, right? And you and Lorraine live happily ever after. Oh yes sir. I have a feeling
                too. Marty, such a nice name. Quiet down, I'm sure the car is fine.
                What you got under here? Alright, punk, now- Alright, c'mon, I think we're safe. It works, ha ha ha ha,
                it works. I finally invent something that works. Next, please.
                Yoo. Get out of town, I didn't know you did anything creative. Ah, let me read some. C'mon, he's not
                that bad. At least he's letting you borrow the car tomorrow night. Listen, woh. Hello, uh excuse me.
                Sorry about your barn. Lorenzo, where're you keys?
